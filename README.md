#  🔄 Push Swap

###  📌 Overview
This project challenges you to sort data on a pair of stacks using a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of moves.

To succeed, you'll need to explore and implement efficient sorting algorithms, choosing the best approach for optimized sorting.

##  🚀 Usage
###  🔧 Compilation

$ make

$ ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23 ...

###  📊 Benchmark Performance

🏆 Sorts 100 numbers in ~550 moves (Goal: <700 moves)

🔥 Sorts 500 numbers in ~4900 moves (Goal: <5500 moves)

###  🛠️ Features

✅ Stack-based sorting algorithm

✅ Efficient use of sorting operations

✅ Optimized move count to stay within project limits

✅ Checker program for validation


Keep in mind this project will only print out the operations to be executed on the stack, if you wish to visualize them, you can do so using a tool such as :
